# FCC - Build a Survey Form

## About:

This is a responsive web design challenge to build a survey form.

While it is possible to use Javascript, I will use only HTML and CSS. One goal here is to utilize Bootstraps built in responsiveness.

## Development Process:

#### 2018-05-27
 - getting everything set up on github and my local repo
 - familiarizing myself with the challenge
 - deciding a color scheme



## Tests to pass:

### Tech Stack
- [ ] You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!
